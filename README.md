# Computer Networks - CSE160

This project is a semester-long effort in creating a full network stack. Tinyos was used to develop the project, with TOSSIM being used to simulate network topologies consisting of sensor nodes. nesC was used to program the network back end and python was used to interface with TOSSIM. Basic packet flooding and neighbor discovery were implemented first and were expanded to support routing/packet forwarding as well as a basic version of TCP with a test application to run. Most of this functionality was implemented in Node.nc.
